Thank you for using Yezure!

These Terms of Service (**“Terms”**) are a binding legal agreement between you and Yezure that govern your use of the websites, applications, and other offerings from Yezure (collectively, the “Yezure Platform”). When used in these Terms, “Yezure,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refers to the Yezure entity set out on Schedule 1 with whom you are contracting.

The Yezure Platform offers an online venue that enables users (“Members”) to publish, offer, search for, and book services. Members who publish and offer services are “Rentors” and Members who search for, book, or use services are “Guests.” Rentors offer items, equiments. Each Service offering, is a `Listing`. You must register an account to access and use many features of the Yezure Platform, and must keep your account information accurate. As the provider of the Yezure Platform, Yezure does not own, control, offer or manage any Listings or Rentor Services. Yezure is not a party to the contracts concluded directly between Rentoes and Guests, nor is Yezure a insurer. Yezure is not acting as an agent in any capacity for any Member, except as specified in the Payments Terms of Service (“Payment Terms”). 

We maintain other **terms and policies** that supplement these Terms like our <nuxt-link to="terms-general-privacy">Privacy Policy</nuxt-link>, which describes our collection and use of personal data, and our <nuxt-link to="terms-general-payments">Payments Terms</nuxt-link>, which govern any payment services provided to Members by Yezure.

If you Rent, you are responsible for understanding and complying with all laws, rules, regulations and contracts with third parties that apply to your Rent Services.

## Guest Terms
### 1. Our Mission.

Our mission is to create a world where everything is shared and productive. We believe that by working together, we can build a substainable world economically good for everyone. 

### 2. Searching and Booking on Yezure.
#### 2.1 Searching.
You can search for Items by location and categories. 

#### 2.2 Booking.
When you book a Listing, you are agreeing to pay all charges for your booking including the Listing price, applicable fees like Yezure’s service fee, taxes, and any other items identified during checkout (collectively, “Total”). You are also agreeing that Yezure Payments may charge and collect any security deposit identified during checkout. When you receive the booking confirmation, a contract for Rent Services (sometimes called a reservation in these Terms) is formed directly between you and the Rent. The cancellation policy and any other rules, standards, policies, or requirements identified in the Listing or during checkout form part of your contract with the Rentor. 

#### 2.3 Items Reservations.
An item reservation is a limited licence to use the Item. The Rentor retains the right to re-claim the Item during your booking, to the extent: (i) it is reasonably necessary, (ii) permitted by your contract with the Rentor, and (iii) consistent with applicable law. If you keep the item past the end date-time, the Rentor has the right to request the item immediatelly and can create a contestation to claim the security deposit.

### 3. Cancellations, Travel Issues, Refunds and Booking Modifications.

#### 3.1 Cancellations, Refunds and Booking Modifications.
3.1 Cancellations, Travel Issues, and Refunds. In general, if as a Guest you cancel a reservation, the amount refunded to you is determined by the <nuxt-link to="terms-general-cancellation">cancellation policy</nuxt-link> that applies to that reservation. But, in certain situations, other policies take precedence and determine what amount is refunded to you. If the Rentor cancels, you will be fully refunded.

#### 3.2 Booking Modifications.
Guests and Rentors are responsible for any booking modifications they agree to make via the Yezure Platform or direct Yezure customer service to make on their behalf ("Booking Modifications"), and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees, or taxes associated with any Booking Modification.

### 4. Your Responsibilities and Assumption of Risk.

#### 4.1 Your Responsibilities.
You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you invite to join while using the item or provide access to any item. For example, this means: (i) you are responsible for returning the item in the condition it was in when you took it, and (ii) you must act with integrity, treat others with respect, and comply with applicable laws at all times. 

**4.2 Your Assumption of Risk. You acknowledge that many activities carry inherent risks and agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Yezure Platform and any Content, including your use of the item, participation in any Experience with the item, or any other interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online. This means it is your responsibility to investigate a Host Item to determine whether it is suitable for you. For example, Host Item may carry a risk of illness, bodily injury, disability, or death, and you freely and willfully assume those risks by choosing to participate in those Host Items.**

## Rentor Terms
### 5. Renting on Yezure.
#### 5.1 Rent.
5.1 Rent. As a Rentor, Yezure offers you the opportunity to share your Items with our vibrant community of Guests—and earn money doing it. It’s easy to create a Listing and you are in control of how you rent—set your price, availability, and rules for each Listing.

#### 5.2 Contacting with Guests.
5.2 Contracting with Guests. When you accept a booking request, or receive a booking confirmation through the Yezure Platform, you are entering into a contract directly with the Guest, and are responsible for delivering your Rentor Item under the terms and at the price specified in your Listing. You are also agreeing to pay applicable fees like Yezure’s service fee (and applicable taxes) for each booking. Yezure Payments will deduct amounts you owe from your payout unless we and you agree to a different method. Any terms, policies or conditions that you include in any supplemental contract with Guests must: (i) be consistent with these Terms, our Policies, and the information provided in your Listing, and (ii) be prominently disclosed in your Listing description.

#### 5.3 Independence of Rentors.
Your relationship with Yezure is that of an independent individual or entity and not an employee, agent, joint venturer, or partner of Yezure, except that Yezure Payments acts as a payment collection agent as described in the Payments Terms. Yezure does not direct or control your Rentor Items, and you agree that you have complete discretion whether and when to provide Rentor Items, and at what price and on what terms to offer them.

### 6. Managing Your Listing.
#### 6.1 Creating and Managing Your Listing.
The Yezure Platform provides tools that make it easy for you to set up and manage a Listing. Your Listing must include complete and accurate information about your Rent Items, your price, other charges like delivery fees, return fees, security deposits, and any rules or requirements that apply to your Guests or Listing. You are responsible for keeping your Listing information (including calendar availability) and content (like photos) up-to-date and accurate at all times. We recommend that you obtain appropriate insurance for your Rent Services and suggest you carefully review policy terms and conditions including coverage details and exclusions. You may only maintain one Listing per Item. 

#### 6.2 Know Your Legal Obligations.
You are responsible for understanding and complying with any laws, rules, regulations, and contracts with third parties that apply to your Listing or Rent Item. Some jurisdictions require Rentors to register, get a permit, or obtain a licence before providing certain rental services. In some places, the Rent Services you want to offer may be prohibited altogether. Check your local rules to learn what rules apply to the Rental Services you plan to offer. Information we provide regarding legal requirements is for informational purposes only and you should independently confirm your obligations. You are responsible for handling and using personal data of Guests and others in compliance with applicable privacy laws and these Terms, including our Rent Privacy Standards. If you have questions about how local laws apply you should always seek legal advice.

#### 6.3 Search Ranking.
The ranking of Listings in search results on the Yezure Platform depends on the selected location and categories.

#### 6.4 Your Responsibilities. 
You are responsible and liable for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of anyone you allow to participate in providing your Rentor renting Services. You are responsible for setting your price and establishing rules and requirements for your Listing. You must describe any and all fees and charges in your Listing description and may not collect any additional fees or charges outside the Yezure Platform except those expressly authorized by our <nuxt-link to="terms-general-payments#offline-fees">Offline Fee Policy</nuxt-link>. Do not encourage Guests to create third-party accounts, submit reviews, provide their contact information, or take other actions outside the Yezure Platform in violation of our <nuxt-link to="terms-general-off-platform">Off-Platform Policy</nuxt-link>.

#### 6.5 Renting as a Team or Organization. 
If you work with a co-rentor or rent as part of a team, business, or other organization, the entity and each individual who participates in providing Rent Services is responsible and liable as a Rentor under these Terms. If you accept terms or enter into contracts, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to enter into contracts for and bind your team, business or other organization, and that each entity you use is in good standing under the laws of the place where it is established. If you perform other functions, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to perform those functions. If you instruct Yezure to transfer a portion of your payout to a co-rentor or other Rentors, or to send payments to someone else, you must be authorized to do so, and are responsible and liable for the payment amounts and accuracy of any payout information you provide.

**6.6 Your Assumption of Risk. You acknowledge that renting carries inherent risks and agree that you assume the entire risk arising out of your access to and use of the Yezure Platform, offering Rent Services, or any interaction you have with other Members whether in person or online. You agree that you have had the opportunity to investigate the Yezure Platform and any laws, rules, regulations, or obligations that may be applicable to your Listings or Rent Services and that you are not relying upon any statement of law made by Yezure.**

### 7. Cancellations, Issues, and Booking Modifications.
#### 7.1 Cancellations and Travel Issues.
In general, if a Guest cancels a reservation, the amount paid to you is determined by the cancellation policy that applies to that reservation. As a rentor, you should not cancel on a Guest without a valid reason. If you cancel on a Guest without such a valid reason, we may impose a cancellation fee and other consequences. If: a Guest experiences a Issue (as defined by the Guest Refund Policy), or (ii) a reservation is cancelled, the amount you are paid will be reduced by the amount we refund or otherwise provide to the Guest, and by any other reasonable costs we incur as a result of the cancellation. If a Guest receives a refund after you have already been paid, or the amount of the refund and other costs incurred by Yezure exceeds your payout, Yezure may recover that amount from you, including by offsetting the refund against your future payouts. You agree that Yezure’s Guest Refund Policy, and these Terms preempt the cancellation policy you set in situations where they allow for the cancellation of a reservation and/or the issuance of refunds to Guests. If we reasonably expect to provide a refund to a Guest under one of these policies, we may delay release of any payout for that reservation until a refund decision is made.

#### 7.2 Booking Modifications.
Rentors and Guests are responsible for any Booking Modifications they agree to make via the Yezure Platform or direct Yezure customer service to make on their behalf, and agree to pay any additional amounts, fees or taxes associated with a Booking Modification.

### 8. Taxes.
#### 8.1 Rentor Taxes.
As a rentor, you are responsible for determining and fulfilling your obligations under applicable laws to report, collect, remit, or include in your price any applicable VAT or other indirect taxes, occupancy taxes, tourist, income, or other taxes (**"Taxes"**).

## General Terms
### 9. Reviews.

After each Rent Service, Guests and Rentors will have an opportunity to review each other. Your Review must be accurate and may not contain any discriminatory, offensive, defamatory, or other language that violates our Content Policy or Review Policy. Reviews are not verified by Yezure for accuracy and may be incorrect or misleading.

### 10. Content.

Parts of the Yezure Platform enable you to provide feedback, text, photos, audio, video, information, and other content (collectively, **“Content”**). By providing Content, in whatever form and through whatever means, you grant Yezure a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free, irrevocable, perpetual, sub-licensable and transferable licence to copy, modify, prepare derivative works of, distribute, publish and otherwise exploit, that Content, without limitation. If Content includes personal information, our Privacy Policy describes how we use that personal information. Where Yezure pays for the creation of Content or facilitates its creation, Yezure may own that Content, in which case supplemental terms or disclosures will say that. You are solely responsible for all Content that you provide and warrant that you either own it or are authorized to grant Yezure the rights described in these Terms. You are responsible and liable if any of your Content violates or infringes the intellectual property or privacy rights of any third party. Content must comply with our Content Policy and Nondiscrimination Policy, which prohibit, among other things, discriminatory, obscene, harassing, deceptive, violent, and illegal content. You agree that Yezure may make available services or automated tools to translate Content and that your Content may be translated using such services or tools. Yezure does not guarantee the accuracy or quality of translations and Members are responsible for confirming the accuracy of such translations.

### 11. Fees.

Yezure may charge fees (and applicable Taxes) to Rentors and Guests for use of the Yezure Platform. More information about when service fees apply and how they are calculated can be found on our <nuxt-link to="terms-general-payments">Service Fees page</nuxt-link>. Except as otherwise provided on the Yezure Platform, service fees are non-refundable. Yezure reserves the right to change the service fees at any time, and will provide Members notice of any fee changes before they become effective.

You agree that Yezure may seek to recover from you under any insurance policies you maintain and that Yezure may also pursue against you any remedies it may have available under applicable law. You agree to cooperate in good faith, provide any information Yezure requests, execute documents, and take further reasonable action, in connection with Damage Claims, Member complaints, claims under insurance policies, or other claims related to your provision or use of Host Services.

### 16. Yezure’s Role.

We offer a platform that enables Members to publish, offer, search for, and book Renting Services. While we work hard to ensure our Members have great experiences using Yezure, we do not and cannot control the conduct of Guests and Hosts. You acknowledge that Yezure has the right, but does not have any obligation, to monitor the use of the Yezure Platform and verify information provided by our Members. For example, we may review, disable access to, remove, or edit Content to: (i) operate, secure and improve the Yezure Platform (including for fraud prevention, risk assessment, investigation and customer support purposes); (ii) ensure Members’ compliance with these Terms; (iii) comply with applicable law or the order or requirement of a court, law enforcement or other administrative agency or governmental body; (iv) address Content that we determine is harmful or objectionable; (v) take actions set out in these Terms; and (vi) maintain and enforce any quality or eligibility criteria, including by removing Listings that don’t meet quality and eligibility criteria. Members acknowledge and agree that Yezure administers its Policies (such as our Extenuating Circumstances Policy) and Standards (such as basic requirements for hosts), including decisions about whether and how to apply them to a particular situation, at its sole discretion. Members agree to cooperate with and assist Yezure in good faith, and to provide Yezure with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Yezure with respect to any investigation undertaken by Yezure regarding the use or abuse of the Yezure Platform. Yezure is not acting as an agent for any Member except for where Yezure Payments acts as a collection agent as provided in the Payments Terms.

### 17. Member Accounts.

You must register an account to access and use many features of the Yezure Platform. Registration is only permitted for legal entities, partnerships and natural persons who are 18 years or older. You represent and warrant that you are not a person or entity barred from using the Yezure Platform under the laws of the United States, Canada, your place of residence, or any other applicable jurisdiction. You must provide accurate, current, and complete information during registration and keep your account information up-to-date. You may not register more than one account or transfer your account to someone else. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your account credentials and may not disclose your credentials to any third party. You are responsible and liable for activities conducted through your account and must immediately notify Yezure if you suspect that your credentials have been lost, stolen, or your account is otherwise compromised. If and as permitted by applicable law, we may, but have no obligation to (i) ask you to provide identification or other information, (ii) undertake checks designed to help verify your identity or background, (iii) screen you against third-party databases or other sources and request reports from service providers, and (iv) obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations or their local equivalents.

### 18. Disclaimer of Warranties.
**We provide the Yezure Platform and all Content “as is” without warranty of any kind and we disclaim all warranties, whether express or implied. For example: (i) we do not endorse or warrant the existence, conduct, performance, safety, quality, legality or suitability of any Guest, Rentor, Renting Service, Listing or third party; (ii) we do not warrant the performance or non-interruption of the Yezure Platform; and (iii) we do not warrant that verification, identity or background checks conducted on Listings or Members (if any) will identify past misconduct or prevent future misconduct. Any references to a Member or Listing being "verified" (or similar language) indicate only that the Member or Listing or Yezure has completed a relevant verification or identification process and nothing else. The disclaimers in these Terms apply to the maximum extent permitted by law. If you have statutory rights or warranties we cannot disclaim, the duration of any such statutorily required rights or warranties will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.**

### 19. Limitations on Liability.

**Neither Yezure (including its affiliates and personnel) nor any other party involved in creating, producing, or delivering the Yezure Platform or any Content will be liable for any incidental, special, exemplary or consequential damages, including lost profits, loss of data or loss of goodwill, service interruption, computer damage or system failure or the cost of substitute products or services, or for any damages for personal or bodily injury or emotional distress arising out of or in connection with (i) these Terms, (ii) the use of or inability to use the Yezure Platform or any Content, (iii) any communications, interactions or meetings you may have with someone you interact or meet with through, or as a result of, your use of the Yezure Platform, or (iv) publishing or booking of a Listing, including the provision or use of Host Services, whether based on warranty, contract, tort (including negligence), product liability or any other legal theory, and whether or not Yezure has been informed of the possibility of such damage, even if a limited remedy set out in these Terms is found to have failed of its essential purpose.**

**Except for our obligation to transmit payments to Hosts under these Terms, or make payments under the Yezure Host Guarantee, in no event will Yezure’s aggregate liability for any claim or dispute arising out of or in connection with these Terms, your interaction with any Members, or your use of or inability to use the Yezure Platform, any Content, or any Renting Service, exceed: (A) to Guests, the amount you paid as a Guest during the 12-month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, (B) to Rentors, the amount paid to you as a Rentor in the 12-month period prior to the event giving rise to the liability, or (C) to anyone else, one hundred US dollars ($100 USD).**

**These limitations of liability and damages are fundamental elements of the agreement between you and Yezure. If applicable law does not allow the limitations of liability set out in these Terms, the above limitations may not apply to you.**

### 20. Indemnification.

**To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to release, defend (at Yezure’s option), indemnify, and hold Yezure (including Yezure Payments, other affiliates, and their personnel) harmless from and against any claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable legal and accounting fees, arising out of or in any way connected with: (i) your breach of these Terms (including any supplemental or additional terms that apply to a product or feature) or our Policies your improper use of the Yezure Platform, (iii) your interaction with any Member, stay at an Accommodation, participation in an Experience or other Host Service, including without limitation any injuries, losses or damages (whether compensatory, direct, incidental, consequential or otherwise) of any kind arising in connection with or as a result of such interaction, stay, participation or use, (iv) your failure, or our failure at your direction, to accurately report, collect or remit Taxes, or (v) your breach of any laws, regulations or third-party rights such as intellectual-property or privacy rights.**

### 21. Contracting Entities.

Based on your country of residence or establishment and what you are doing on the Yezure Platform, Schedule 1 below sets out the Yezure entity with whom you are contracting. If we identify, through the Yezure Platform, an Yezure entity other than the one set out on Schedule 1 as being responsible for a product, feature or transaction, the Yezure entity so identified is your contracting entity with respect to that product, feature or transaction. If you change your country of residence or establishment, the Yezure company you contract with (as set out on Schedule 1) and the applicable version of the Terms of Service will be determined by your new country of residence or establishment, from the date on which your country of residence or establishment changes.
