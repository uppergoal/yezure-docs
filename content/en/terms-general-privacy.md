### 4.5 Complying with Law, Responding to Legal Requests, Preventing Harm and Protecting our Rights.

We may disclose your information to courts, law enforcement, governmental or public authorities, tax authorities, or authorized third parties, if and to the extent we are required or permitted to do so by law or where disclosure is reasonably necessary: (i) to comply with our legal obligations, (ii) to comply with a valid legal request or to respond to claims asserted against Yezure, (iii) to respond to a valid legal request relating to a criminal investigation to address alleged or suspected illegal activity, or to respond to or address any other activity that may expose us, you, or any other of our users to legal or regulatory liability (more information on Yezure Law Enforcement Guidelines here), (iv) to enforce and administer our agreements with Members, or (v) to protect the rights, property or personal safety of Yezure, its employees, its Members, or members of the public. For example, if permitted due to the forgoing circumstances, Rent tax information may be shared with tax authorities or other governmental agencies.

Where appropriate, we may notify Members about legal requests unless: (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law, or (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon or harm to Yezure, our Members, or expose Yezure to a claim of obstruction of justice.

For jurisdictions where Yezure facilitates the collection and remittance of Taxes where legally permissible according to applicable law, we may disclose Rentors’ and Guests’ information about transactions, bookings, Accommodations and occupancy Taxes to the applicable tax authority, such as Rentor and Guest names, Listing addresses, transaction dates and amounts, tax identification number(s), the amount of taxes received (or due) by Rentors from Guests, and contact information.

In jurisdictions where Yezure facilitates or requires a registration, notification, permit, or license application of a Rent with a local governmental authority through Yezure in accordance with local law, we may share information of participating Rents with the relevant authority, both during the application process and, periodically thereafter, such as the Rentor’s full name and contact details, Accommodation address, tax identification number, Listing details, and number of nights booked.

### 4.6 Programs with Managers and Owners.

We may share personal information of Rentors and Guests such as booking information, and information related to compliance with applicable laws such as short-term rental laws with landlords, management companies, and/or property owners (the “Building Management”), in order to facilitate programs with Building Management. For example, guest booking and personal information, including guest contact information, may be shared with the Building Management of the building, complex, or community where a rent lives and/or the listing is located, to facilitate renting services, compliance with applicable laws, security, billing, and other services.

### 4.7 Rentor Information Provided to Yezure for Work Customers.

If a booking is designated as being for business or work purpose and (1) is made by a Guest affiliated with an Enterprise, (2) the Enterprise is enrolled in Yezure for Work, we may disclose information related to the booking to the Enterprise (e.g., name of the Rentor, Accommodation address, booking dates, Listing details, etc.) to the extent necessary for the adequate performance of Yezure’s contract with the Enterprise and to provide the services. At the request of the Enterprise or the Guest, we may also share this information with third parties engaged by the Enterprise to provide support services.

### 4.8 Service Providers.

We share personal information with affiliated and unaffiliated service providers to help us run our business, including service providers that help us: (i) verify your identity or authenticate your identification documents, (ii) check information against public databases, (iii) conduct background or police checks, fraud prevention, and risk assessment, (iv) perform product development, maintenance and debugging, (v) allow the provision of the Yezure Services through third-party platforms and software tools (e.g. through the integration with our APIs), (vi) provide customer service, advertising, or payments services, (vii) process, handle or assess insurance claims or similar claims, or (viii) facilitate non-profit and charitable activities consistent with Yezure’s mission. These providers are contractually bound to protect your personal information and have access to your personal information to perform these tasks.

### 4.9 Business Transfers.

If Yezure undertakes or is involved in any merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, bankruptcy, or insolvency event, then we may sell, transfer or share some or all of our assets, including your information in connection with such transaction or in contemplation of such transaction (e.g., due diligence). In this event, we will notify you before your personal information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## 5. OTHER IMPORTANT INFORMATION
### 5.1 Analyzing your Communications.

We may review, scan, or analyze your communications on the Yezure Platform for reasons outlined in the “How We Use Information We Collect” section of this policy, including fraud prevention, risk assessment, regulatory compliance, investigation, product development, research, analytics, enforcing our <nuxt-link to="terms-general-service">Terms of Service</nuxt-link>, and customer support purposes. For example, as part of our fraud prevention efforts, we scan and analyze messages to mask contact information and references to other sites. In some cases, we may also scan, review, or analyze messages to debug, improve, and expand product offerings. We use automated methods where reasonably possible. Occasionally we may need to manually review communications, such as for fraud investigations and customer support, or to assess and improve the functionality of these automated tools. We will not review, scan, or analyze your messaging communications to send third-party marketing messages to you and we will not sell reviews or analyses of these communications.

### 5.2 Linking Third-Party Accounts.

You can link your Yezure account with certain third-party services like social networks. Your contacts on these third-party services are referred to as “Friends.” When you direct the data sharing by creating this link:

some of the information provided to us from linking accounts may be published on your public profile,
your activities on the Yezure Platform may be displayed to your Friends on the Yezure Platform and/or that third-party service,
a link to your public profile on that third-party service may be included in your Yezure public profile,
other Yezure users may be able to see any Friends that you may have in common with them, or that you are a Friend of their Friend if applicable,
other Yezure users may be able to see any schools, hometowns or other groups you have in common with them as listed on your linked social networking service,
information you provide to us from the linking of your accounts may be stored, processed and transmitted for fraud prevention and risk assessment purposes, and
publication and display of information that you provide to the Yezure Platform through this linkage is subject to your settings and authorizations on the Yezure Platform and the third-party service.

### 5.3 Third-Party Partners & Integrations.

Parts of Yezure may link to third-party services, not owned or controlled by Yezure, such as Google Maps/Earth. Use of these services is subject to the privacy policies of those providers, such as Google Maps/Earth Additional Terms of Use, Google Privacy Policy (see here for more information on how Google uses information), and Citi Privacy Policy. Yezure does not own or control these third parties and when you interact with them you are providing your information to them.

## 6. YOUR RIGHTS
You can exercise any of the rights described in this section consistent with applicable law. Please note that we may ask you to verify your identity and request before taking further action on your request.

### 6.1 Managing Your Information.

You can access and update some of your personal information through your Account settings. If you connected your Yezure Account to a third-party service, like Facebook, Google or Twitter, you can change your settings and unlink from that service in your Account settings. You are responsible for keeping your personal information up to date.

### 6.2 Data Access and Portability.

In some jurisdictions, applicable law may entitle you to request certain copies of your personal information or information about how we handle your personal information, request copies of personal information that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, and/or request that we transmit this information to another service provider (where technically feasible).

### 6.3 Data Erasure.

In certain jurisdictions, you can request that your personal information be deleted. Please note that if you request the erasure of your personal information:

We may retain your personal information as necessary for our legitimate business interests, such as prevention of money laundering, fraud detection and prevention, and enhancing safety. For example, if we suspend an Yezure Account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain information from that Yezure Account to prevent that Member from opening a new Yezure Account in the future.
We may retain and use your personal information to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations. For example, Yezure may keep information for tax, legal reporting and auditing obligations.
Information you have shared with others (e.g., Reviews, forum postings) will continue to be publicly visible on Yezure, even after your Yezure Account is cancelled. However, attribution of such information to you will be removed. Some copies of your information (e.g., log records) will remain in our database, but are disassociated from personal identifiers.
Because we take measures to protect data from accidental or malicious loss and destruction, residual copies of your personal information may not be removed from our backup systems for a limited period of time.

## 7. SECURITY
While no organization can guarantee perfect security, we are continuously implementing and updating administrative, technical, and physical security measures to help protect your information against unauthorized access, loss, destruction, or alteration.

## 8. CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY

We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time in accordance with applicable law. If we do so, we will post the revised Privacy Policy and update the “Last Updated” date at the top. In case of material changes, we will also provide you with notice of the modification by email at least thirty (30) days before the effective date. If you disagree with the revised Privacy Policy, you can cancel your Account. If you do not cancel your Account before the date the revised Privacy Policy becomes effective, your continued access to or use of the Yezure Platform will be subject to the revised Privacy Policy.
