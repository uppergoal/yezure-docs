## Booking Payments

All payments are processed by Stripe and held in trust by Yezure until the booking has been `completed`, then Yezure will release the funds to the Rentor. If the booking start date is 2 days or less away from the current date, or if the booking status is `activated` then the Guest will be required to pay 100% of the booking total to confirm and reserve the item(s).

If the booking start date is greater than 2 days from the current date then a draft invoice is created. The remaining balance will automatically be taken from their account on the date that is 2 days before the booking start date.

## Refunds
If at any point you do receive a full or partial refund from a booking, Yezure will always reduce the amount of their service fee, and processing fee. Refunds will be determined by the item’s <nuxt-link to="terms-general-cancellation">Cancellation Policy</nuxt-link> on the booking and will be sent from Yezure.

Depending on your bank, you will see it as a credit on your account within 5 – 10 business days from the time we process the refund. We can only refund the amount back to the credit card used to pay the initial balance, it cannot be transferred to a different card or account.

## Payout
Yezure will only release the payout amount to the Rentor once the booking has been marked as completed. Depending on your bank the amount may take 3 – 5 business days to reach your account. The Payout Amount will be the booking total amount reduced by the Platform Service Fee, Payment processing Fees, and any other outstanding amounts the Rentor may owe.

Yezure does reserve the right to reduce your payout amount if you owe any outstanding service or admin fees. Yezure also reserves the authority to reduce the payout amount if the related booking has any refunds or charges from a cancellation or a dispute.

Yezure will include the tax (if charged) on the booking on the payout to your account. This will allow you to collect the tax and pay your local government as needed. Please check with a local attorney to see if you are required to do so.

## Deposits
The deposit amount is decided by the Rentor and will be processed when the booking status is marked `activated`. The security deposit is a hold taken on the Guest credit card and will only be executed if a contestation is approved. 

Deposits will be released when the booking is marked as `completed`.

## Banking Information
Yezure will ask you to enter your banking information in the payments area of your account processed by Stripe. Please be aware that this is the only place and time that Yezure will ask for your banking information. We will never ask you to send money via email or e-transfer to us or to another member.

By entering in your banking information, Yezure will be able to automatically directly deposit your payout amounts into the specified account.

## Taxes
Yezure does give the Rentor the ability to collect taxes by adding the taxes percentages in your settings. The tax amount will be included on your payout amount to give you the opportunity to repay your local government as necessary. It is your obligation to seek council of a certified accountant or attorney to see if you are required to collect taxes or not.

Yezure will charge tax on the amounts collected the platform service fee.

## Fees
There are no fees to register for the Yezure Services. However, Yezure charges fees for each transaction made through the Platform (“Transaction Fees” or “Platform Service Fees”). In particular, Yezure charges the Guest a fee for each completed transaction, the fees will be deducted upon the payout. Yezure charges the Guest 10% Platform Service Fee which allows us to maintain and improve the Yezure platform and provide world-class support to our members. If you rent out an Item as a Guest or rent an Item as a Guest, you agree to pay all Platform Service Fees described herein or otherwise quoted to you at the time of the transaction.
