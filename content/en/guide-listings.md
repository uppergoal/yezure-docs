## Your listings
Are you ready to rent your items that are sleeping at home? Go to `Your listings` via the profile menu.

### Create a listing
Once on the page of your displays, press the `+` allowing you to create a listing with a title and a description.
The title should not exceed 60 characters and the description should not exceed 150 for search engine optimization (SEO).

### Edit a listing
Once the listing has been created, you must associate it with an address, a category, a rate, a minimum duration.

It is strongly recommended to add photos and determine a default photo.

Then you have the option to select or complete the other fields.

### Publish a listing
To publish a listing, you must update your payment account and you must confirm your email address.

Once these steps are completed, go to the listing you want to publish (`Edit`), and select` Publish`.
