## How to create an account?

If you don't have a Yezure account yet, go to [yezure.com] (https://yezure.com/) and click on 'Connect'.

You can create an account using your email address, phone number, or Google account. Creating an account is free.

After registering, be sure to complete your account before renting things. We recommend adding an email address to your account to receive email notifications.

## Look for listings

In the top menu, search for a specific city and press 'Search'. You will be redirected to a page displaying all the ads according to your search city.

You can also search by categories.
