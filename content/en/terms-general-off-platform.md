## Off-Platform Policy
By hosting on Yezure, you agree to abide by our terms and policies, including our Terms of Service, which we reserve the right to enforce at our sole discretion. In the event of repeated or severe violations, we may suspend or permanently deactivate a person’s account.

In order to protect our community and business, the following behaviours are prohibited:

### Asking guests for feedback off of Yezure
Asking for guests to review you or your listing off of Yezure takes valuable input about a guest’s stay away from Yezure’s community. We want guests to share their feedback directly on Yezure so that other guests may benefit from their insights. This includes:

- Asking guests to review an Yezure stay on a non-Yezure website, or taking reviews from Yezure and posting them on a non-Yezure website
- Asking guests to fill out a survey regarding an Yezure stay via a non-Yezure website or form off of Yezure

### Asking guests for contact information prior to booking
Asking guests their phone number and email address prior to booking is currently permitted.
<!-- All guest communications prior to booking should be on Yezure. Asking guests for contact information prior to booking is prohibited. This includes: -->

<!-- Asking guests for their phone number or email address prior to booking
Asking guests to call or email in order to discuss a reservation prior to booking (e.g. offering a deeper discount for booking directly by phone).
Asking guests to go to a third-party website or fill out a form in order to make a booking (e.g. stating reservations with larger groups need to go through a separate website) -->
### Asking guests for contact information after a booking or misusing contact information provided by Yezure
This includes asking for or using contact information for any reasons unrelated to a guest’s stay, or in a way that compromises the quality of a guest’s stay. Guests should be able to communicate directly with hosts about their stays through Yezure or via phone calls and texts. Soliciting additional contact information (email address, residential address) should be avoided unless needed for legal or compliance reasons (such as local laws or HOA rules). This includes, but is not limited to:

- Asking guests for an email address for the purpose of their Yezure stay and then subscribing them to marketing materials
- Asking guests to move the conversation to texts or emails in order to circumvent Yezure’s platform or Resolution Centre
- Asking guests for contact information after a booking in order to run background checks
- Asking guests to send photos of their government-issued ID prior to arrival
- Guests should always feel like they have an option to opt-out of receiving marketing materials.

### Asking guests to create a separate account or install a third-party app in order to access their listing
Guests booking through Yezure should be able to access their listing using only the Yezure app. Additional registration or installation of additional apps should not be mandatory unless it’s required for legal or compliance reasons (such as local laws, HOA rules, building security rules). In such instances, hosts must include this in their listing description, so guests understand this additional step is a requirement prior to booking.

This includes:
- Asking guests to create a separate account or register on another website besides Yezure.com
- Asking guests to install a third-party app to access a listing (unless the third-party app has passed our security vetting)
